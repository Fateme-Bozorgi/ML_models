# ML Models  

## Regression Model Evaluation: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression  

This repository presents a practical implementation of three distinct regression models to predict resistivity values based on geological features. The models included in this comparison are:  

- **Decision Tree Regression**  
- **Random Forest Regression**  
- **Linear Regression**  

### Evaluating Model Performance  

The MSE values for each model are displayed, offering quantifiable insights into each modelâ€™s predictive capabilities in this specific problem. 

### Visual Comparisons  

Scatter plots illustrate the relationship between actual and predicted values, enabling visual assessment of model performance across models. These plots help to understand how closely the predicted resistivity values align with the actual ones.
